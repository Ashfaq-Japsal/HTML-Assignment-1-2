    <h2>The Story in the Book</h2>

    <h3>Chapter 1</h3>

    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of<span>
            Nature, New Scientist,</span> an all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed
        copy of<span> On The Road,</span> It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in these
        four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>

    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wild Quote proclaiming that
        <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work,
        unraveling the secrets of the llama DNA, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <span>did</span> think she had
        something better to do.
